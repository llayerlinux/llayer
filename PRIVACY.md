LastLayer is primarily a local desktop application.
It stores settings and theme files on your device and connects to network services only for specific features.

## Data Stored Locally
- Settings and user preferences (including the selected theme and interface options).
- Theme metadata, local cache, preview/avatar cache, and restore points.
- Temporary files created during downloads/uploads and script execution.

## Network Activity
LastLayer may connect to:
- The configured LastLayer server (default: llayer.tech) to fetch themes, check updates, retrieve statistics, upload/edit themes, and (if enabled) send performance metrics.
- Third-party hosts referenced in theme metadata (previews/avatars), and the Reddit API for post statistics.

## Theme Uploads and Credentials
When uploading or editing a theme, the application sends the files and metadata you provide, including edit/authentication passwords required by server-side workflows.

## Optional Performance Metrics
Performance metrics are disabled by default and are sent only if explicitly enabled in settings.
When enabled, sent data includes theme install/apply timing and a theme identifier.

## Third-Party Scripts
Theme install/post-install scripts run locally on your machine.
Depending on script contents, they may access files, processes, package managers, and network resources.

## Data Retention and Deletion
Data remains on your device until you remove it.
You can manually delete settings, cache, restore points, and theme files from your home directory.
